    "section": "",
    "text": "📋 Seminar overview\nThis seminar will survey research on how adult listeners adapt perceptual categories in speech perception. The goal is to equip students with a foundational knowledge of relevant speech perception methods, their use in understanding perceptual flexibility, and what flexibility in speech perception tells us about linguistic representations and the way that listeners process speech. The common thread across topics and phenomena will be the finding that speech perception is a dynamic process, and that listeners actively track and learn about speech as they experience it. This seminar presupposes some knowledge of phonetics and phonology: LEL2A + 2B or MSc Introduction to Phonetics and Phonology, or equivalent.",
