Working on it from these weeks until the due date should give you plenty of time, and hopefully reduce your stress during the busy finals period.\nThis website has instructions for each of the five parts, which you can navigate at left.\nIf you prefer a pdf, that can be accessed and downloaded here.",

Include the word list item number, IPA transcription, orthographic transcription, and gloss/translation for the items that you choose. You can report them in a table for ease of presentation.\nUsing a TextGrid, annotate the 6 items you have identified. Describe your annotation methods in text. Where did you take your formant measurements from? How did you determine this point? How did you extract the formant measurements? (See Week 4 lecture and lab).\nInclude at least one illustrative spectrogram with its accompanying TextGrid showing your annotations.\nReport the frequency values of the first and second formants for all 6 tokens that you have measured. This can be reported in a table.\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Core Task 2\nCreate a visualization of your vowel space with F2 on the x axis and F1 on the y axis, and arrayed in the typical fashion. Place this figure in your submission. This can be done in Excel, other computer programs, or simply by hand on graph paper, and scanned or photographed on your phone. See the Week 4 lab for details and templates.\n\n\n2.3.3 Core Task 3\nChoose 2 of the 6 vowels from above, and perform the following tasks for both vowels.\n\nLocate the approximate midpoint of the vowel (50% of the vowel duration). Zoom into this location and identify one period in the waveform. Include a screenshot which shows several periods, for which the time stamps are visible.\nReport this value for the period and then compute F0 using the duration of the period measure. Recall the inverse relationship between period and frequency and see Week 4 lecture for this.\n\n\n\n2.3.4 📌 Advanced task\nWith F0, and your previously computed formant measures, take these pieces of information (F0, F1 ,F2, F3), create a schematic line drawing of the vowel spectrum, with one vertical line representing each harmonic. This must have the following to receive full marks. See the Week 4 lecture slides for an example of what this can look like.\n\nAn x axis which allows you to show frequency in an accurate and legible way, and a reasonable range.\nThe y axis can be totally schematic, and does not require actual intensity values - you can just label it to be ‘louder’ versus ‘quieter’, or similar.\nA clear representation of F1, F2, and F3, which also approximates standard vowel spectrum properties, e.g., declination in harmonic’s intensity at higher frequencies.\n\nYou can produce this in anyway that is easy to you. You could draw it by hand (graph paper would be helpful), take a picture or scan, and add it to your submission.

The tie bars have been removed from diphthong vowels, along with diacritics that would indicate information about vowel length.\nIn the original transcription, the [t], [d], [n], [s], [l], and [r] phones were modified by a diacritic that indicates they are produced at the teeth rather than the alveolar ridge.

In this alignment not all boundaries between phones will have a corresponding boundary in the tier you are aligning them with (i.e., not all phones will be separated).\n\nProvide a screenshot of your annotations, making sure that they are legible on the page. You may need to split the annotation over two pages, and you may find it helpful to put the image in landscape orientation. See the Week 8 workshop for examples and instructions.\n\n\nWARNING: The transcription given above is a (simplified) approximation given by the authors of the paper. It may present you with two notable challenges.\n\nFirstly, [r], though described as a voiced trill, may be realised by just a period of closure and release. This closure may or may not be voiced and your text grid segmentations should try to hew to the acoustics in this case, i.e. align the voicing tier based on the presence or absence of acoustic evidence for voicing in the waveform and spectrogram.\nSecondly, other segmentations may also deviate in their acoustics from the transcription. If you encounter tricky cases you may remark on them briefly. Again you should strive to base your segmentation on the acoustic evidence for voicing and oral closure.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 📌 Advanced Tasks\nFor this part you should focus only the first portion of the passage, that is:\n[ bɪr kʰʏnɪ ]\nBased on the two text grids you have created, a combination of the intervals will correspond to individual speech segments in the transcription (like [n]). Choose two such intervals, and describe the following (a few sentences for each).\n\nWhat acoustic information in the spectrogram led you to place the boundaries on both tiers where you did? Refer to specific frequencies and locations, describing, for example, acoustic information that you used to identify presence or absence of voicing, the onset of a vowel, etc.\nWhat acoustic information in the wave form led you to place the boundaries where you did? How does this relate to the spectrogram?\n\nComment briefly, in a few sentences, on the extent to which the waveform vs. the spectrogram was useful for both boundaries.",
