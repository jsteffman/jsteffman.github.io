But remember, you will have a lot of the required knowledge to work on the portfolio when it is released to you. Working on it from the release date until the due date should give you plenty of time, and hopefully reduce your stress during the busy finals period.\nThis website has instructions for each of the five parts, which you can navigate at left.\nIf you prefer a pdf, that can be accessed here. The sub-folders in the zipped folder are for each sub-part of the portfolio, excluding part 5 for which there are no materials.",

Include the word list item number, IPA transcription, orthographic transcription, and gloss/translation for the items that you choose. You can report them in a table for ease of presentation.\nUsing a TextGrid, annotate the 6 items you have identified. Describe your annotation methods in text. Where did you take your formant measurements from? How did you determine this point? How did you extract the formant measurements?\nInclude at least one illustrative spectrogram with its accompanying TextGrid showing your annotations.\nReport the frequency values of the first and second formants for all 6 tokens that you have measured. This can be reported in a table.\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Core Task 2\nCreate a visualization of your vowel space with F2 on the x axis and F1 on the y axis, and arrayed in the typical fashion. Place this figure in your submission. This can be done in Excel, other computer programs, or simply by hand on graph paper, and scanned or photographed on your phone. See the Week 4 lab for details and templates.\n\n\n2.3.3 Core Task 3\nChoose 2 of the 6 vowels from above, and perform the following tasks for both vowels.\n\nLocate the approximate midpoint of the vowel (50% of the vowel duration). Zoom into this location and identify one period in the waveform. Include a screenshot which shows several periods, for which the time stamps are visible.\nReport this value for the period and then compute F0 using the duration of the period measure. Recall the inverse relationship between period and frequency and see Week 4 lecture for this.\nWith F0, and your previously computed formant measures, take these pieces of information (F0, F1 ,F2, F3), create a schematic line drawing of the vowel spectrum, with one vertical line representing each harmonic. This must have the following to receive full marks. See the Week 4 lecture slides for an example of what this can look like.\n\nAn x axis which allows you to show frequency in an accurate and legible way, and a reasonable range.\nThe y axis can be totally schematic, and does not require actual intensity values - you can just label it to be ‘louder’ versus ‘quieter’, or similar.\nA clear representation of F1, F2, and F3, which also approximates standard vowel spectrum properties, e.g., declination in harmonic’s intensity at higher frequencies.\n\n\nYou can produce this in anyway that is easy to you. You could draw it by hand (graph paper would be helpful), take a picture or scan, and add it to your submission. Or, you can make it using e.g. powerpoint, or any other programme that let’s you draw and/or manipulate shapes.\n\n\n2.3.4 Advanced task\nConsider other factors, including contextual that may influence vowel formant measures. Provide information about the tokens that you investigated, and the ways in which the factors you identify influence your interpretation of the patterns that you have observed.a",

The tie bars have been removed from diphthong vowels, along with diacritics that would indicate information about vowel length. In the original transcription, the [t], [d], [n], [s], [l], and [r] phones were modified by a diacritic that indicates they are produced at the teeth rather than the alveolar ridge.
