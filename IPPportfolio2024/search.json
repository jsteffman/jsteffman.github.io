    "text": "📋 Portfolio overview\nThe assessment for this course is made up of a portfolio of five exercises that you can complete starting in week 6.\nThis may seem like a lot! But remember, you will have a lot of the required knowledge to work on the portfolio when it is released to you. Working on it from the release date until the due date should give you plenty of time, and hopefully reduce your stress during the busy finals period.\nThis website has instructions for each of the five parts, which you can navigate at left. If you prefer a pdf, that can be accessed here. The sub-folders in the zipped folder are for each sub-part of the portfolio, excluding part 5 for which there are no materials.",

Therefore, it is in your best interest to focus on the Core tasks and make sure that you do them well.\n\nNote also that the 2-page limit per exercise, and 10-page limit overall, applies regardless of whether you include Stretch tasks in your submission.",

Your task is to identify and select pairs of words that exemplify this contrast at all three places of articulation.

Supply enough detail that someone could replicate your annotation.\n\nInclude at least two illustrative spectrograms and waveforms with accompanying TextGrid annotations showing your annotations for one voiced sound and one voiceless sound. These can be screenshots from Praat.\nReport the Voice Onset Time for all 6 tokens that you have measured. This can be in a table.\nAnswer the question: What kind of voicing contrast does this appear to be; think about the different types discussed in week 5 (voiced vs. unaspirated, and unaspirated vs. aspirated) relate your reasoning about this to the data you have mentioned.\nAre there any patterns in place of articulation that you notice?\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Advanced tasks\nDiscuss other factors, including contextual factors, that may influence the VOT measures that you have collected.

You should have 6 items in total, one for each vowel.\nReport which word list items you are focusing on for your investigation. Include the word list item number, IPA transcription, orthographic transcription, and gloss/translation for the items that you choose. You can report them in a table for ease of presentation.\nUsing a TextGrid, annotate the 6 items you have identified. Describe your annotation methods in text. Where did you take your formant measurements from? How did you determine this point? How did you extract the formant measurements?\nInclude at least one illustrative spectrogram with its accompanying TextGrid showing your annotations.\nReport the frequency values of the first and second formants for all 6 tokens that you have measured. This can be reported in a table.\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Core Task 2\nCreate a visualization of your vowel space with F2 on the x axis and F1 on the y axis, and arrayed in the typical fashion. Place this figure in your submission. This can be done in Excel, other computer programs, or simply by hand on graph paper, and scanned or photographed on your phone. See the Week 4 lab for details and templates.\n\n\n2.3.3 Core Task 3\nChoose 2 of the 6 vowels and perform the following tasks for both vowels.\n\nLocate the approximate midpoint of the vowel (50% of the vowel duration). Zoom into this location and identify one period in the waveform. Include a screenshot which shows several period, and for which the time stamps are visible.\nReport this value for the period and then compute F0 using duration of the the period measure. Recall the inverse relationship between period and frequency and see Week 4 lecture for this.\nWith F0, and your previously computed formant measures, take these pieces of information (F0, F1 ,F2, F3), create a schematic line drawing of the vowel spectrum, with one vertical line representing each harmonic. This must have the following to receive full marks. See the Week 4 lecture slides for an example of what this can look like.\n\nAn x axis which allows you to show frequency in an accurate and legible way, and a reasonable range.\nThe y axis can be totally schematic, and does not require actual intensity values - you can just label it to be ‘louder’ versus ‘quieter’, or similar.\nA clear representation of F1, F2, and F3, which also approximates standard vowel spectrum properties, e.g., declination in harmonic’s intensity at higher frequencies.\n\n\nYou can produce this in anyway that is easy to you. You could draw it by hand (graph paper would be helpful), take a picture or scan, and add it to your submission. Or, you can make it using e.g. powerpoint, or any other programme that let’s you draw and/or manipulate shapes.\n\n\n2.3.4 Advanced task\nConsider other factors, including contextual that may influence vowel formant measures. Provide information about the tokens that you investigated, and the ways in which the factors you identify influence your interpretation of the patterns that you have observed.a",
