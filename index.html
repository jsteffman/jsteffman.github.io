 <p class= "research"> I'm a postdoctoral fellow at Northwestern University where I work in 
    the <a href=https://www.prosodylab.linguistics.northwestern.edu>Prosody and Speech Dynamics Lab</a>. Prior to this, I received my PhD from <a href=https://linguistics.ucla.edu> UCLA</a>. 
    
       <br>  <br> 
    
 
    
    My research program focuses on how prosodic/intonational structure, and its phonetic correlates, influence speech processing.  <a href=docs/Steffman_2020.pdf> My dissertation </a> <i>Prosodic prominence in vowel perception and spoken language processing</i>, explores one particular domain where these questions are especially interesting.
     
     
      <br> <br> 
     
    I'm more generally interested in phonetics and laboratory phonology, and in paricular speech perception, prosody, and psycholinguistics. In another strand of research, I describe phonetic structure and patterns in language, mostly from acoustic data.

          <ul class="news2">
              
    <li class="news2"> The role of different aspects of phonological and lexical organization in speech perception: disentangling and comparing the influence of biphone probability and neighborhood density in phonetic categorization, and online processing using eyetracking - in collaboration with Megha Sundara. See <a href= docs/Steffman_Sundara.pdf> [here]</a> for a manuscript.</li>    
                   
    <li class="news2">  The influence of intonational structure and context on listeners' perception of durational cues, and processing of pitch accent in word recognition in Tokyo Japanese - in collaboration with Hironori Katsuda.                  
              
    <li class="news2"> The articulation and acoustics of voiced aspirated sounds in Yemba (Dschang), a language spoken in Cameroon - in collaboration with Matt Faytak and Rolain Tankou. Yemba has voiced and fully aspirated (not breathy-voiced) segments, for example [ndʰù] 'distant relative' (n.b. NOT [ndʱù]), cf. [ndù] 'river'. 
        
        <br><br> 
    We're using EGG to explore laryngeal articulation and timing patterns for voicing in these segments. We're also intersted in how voice quality for voiced+aspirated sounds differs from their unaspirated counterparts. To this end, were analyzing acoustic voice quality measures in tandem with EGG parameters. See <a href= docs/Faytak_Steffman_2021.pdf> [here]</a> for a recent presentation. 
        
                <br><br> 
        I'm also working with Jae Weller to test how both aspiration and voicing in Yemba influence the articulation and acoustics of the following vowel.</li> 
        
    
    <li class="news2">  The influence of tonal cues to prosodic phrasing on the perception of segmental contrasts in Seoul Korean, as a function of domain initial strengthening - in collaboration with Sahyang Kim, Taehong Cho and Sun-Ah Jun. 
        
    <li class="news2"> Phonetic structure in San Sebastián del Monte Mixtec, including the realization of so-called rearticulated vowels and glottalization - in collaboration with Iara Mantenuto and Félix Cortés.
                       
           
    <li class="news2"> The role of pitch and durational cues to focus in the processing of contrastive pitch accents in English - in collaboration with Chie Nakamura and Sun-Ah Jun. Previous work has shown that listeners make predictions about upcoming information based on focus structure. For example, if I tell you "I wore a green hat, my friend wore a BLUE ..." you might expect the blue object will be a hat because the color term is in contrast. We're interested what phonetic properties inform this sort of predictive processing - more specifically - how do pitch cues and duration serve independently to shape listeners' predictions? How do they combine? We're exploring these questions with eyetracking.
