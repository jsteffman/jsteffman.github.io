 <p class= "research"> Hello and welcome to my website!    <br>  <br> I'm a phonetician/ laboratory-phonologist/ psycholinguist/ cognitive-scientist.

     And a postdoctoral fellow at Northwestern University where I work in
    the <a href=https://www.prosodylab.linguistics.northwestern.edu>Prosody and Speech Dynamics Lab</a>. <br> Prior to this, I received my PhD in Linguistics from <a href=https://linguistics.ucla.edu> UCLA</a> in December 2020.

       <br>  <br>

    My research centers on examining how prosodic and intonational patterns influence speech perception and spoken language processing, especially in the perception of speech timing, and the uptake of segmental information.

     <a href=docs/Steffman_2020.pdf> My dissertation </a> explores one domain where these questions are especially interesting.



    <br> <br>
    More broadly, I research speech perception and prosody (production and perception). In another strand of research, I describe phonetic structure and patterns in language, mostly from acoustic data.

           Sahyang Kim, Taehong Cho, Sun-Ah Jun and I have just published our paper <i> Prosodic phrasing mediates listeners’ perception of temporal cues: Evidence from the Korean Accentual Phrase </i> in  Journal of Phonetics. This project is one of my favorites, and shows prosodic phrasing plays a role in perception that is independent of speech rate normalization effects -

                  Check it out: <a href= docs/Steffman_et_al_Korean_AP.pdf>[preprint] <a href= https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0095447022000316>[link]</a>

    <ul class="news2">



    <li class="news2"> The impact of vowel-initial glottalization as a prominence cue in vowel perception and online processing. See <a href= docs/Steffman_glottalization.pdf> [here]</a> for a manuscript.</li>

    <li class="news2"> The role of different aspects of phonological and lexical organization in speech perception: disentangling and comparing the influence of biphone probability and neighborhood density in phonetic categorization, and online processing using eyetracking - in collaboration with Megha Sundara. See <a href= docs/Steffman_Sundara.pdf> [here]</a> for a manuscript.</li>

     <!-- <li class="news2">  The influence of tonal cues to prosodic phrasing on the perception of segmental contrasts in Seoul Korean, as a function of domain initial strengthening - in collaboration with Sahyang Kim, Taehong Cho and Sun-Ah Jun. See <a href= docs/Steffman_et_al_Korean_AP.pdf> [here]</a> for a manuscript.</li>  -->

    <li class="news2">  The influence of intonational structure and context on listeners' perception of durational cues, and processing of pitch accent in word recognition in Tokyo Japanese - in collaboration with Hironori Katsuda.

    <li class="news2"> The articulation and acoustics of voiced aspirated sounds in Yemba (Dschang), a language spoken in Cameroon - in collaboration with Matt Faytak and Rolain Tankou. Yemba has voiced and fully aspirated (not breathy-voiced) segments, for example [ndʰù] 'distant relative' (n.b. NOT [ndʱù]), cf. [ndù] 'river'.

    <br><br>
    We're using EGG to explore laryngeal articulation and timing patterns for voicing in these segments. We're also intersted in how voice quality for voiced+aspirated sounds differs from their unaspirated counterparts. To this end, we're analyzing acoustic voice quality measures in tandem with EGG parameters. See <a href= docs/Faytak-Steffman-Tankou_ACAL5152.pdf> [here]</a> for a recent presentation.


    <li class="news2"> Phonetic structure in San Sebastián del Monte Mixtec, including the realization of so-called rearticulated vowels and glottalization - in collaboration with Jae Weller, Iara Mantenuto and Félix Cortés.


     <!--    <li class="news2"> The role of pitch and durational cues to focus in the processing of contrastive pitch accents in English - in collaboration with Chie Nakamura and Sun-Ah Jun. Previous work has shown that listeners make predictions about upcoming information based on focus structure. For example, if I tell you "I wore a green hat, my friend wore a BLUE ..." you might expect the blue object will be a hat because the color term is in contrast. We're interested what phonetic properties inform this sort of predictive processing - more specifically - how do pitch cues and duration serve independently to shape listeners' predictions? How do they combine? We're exploring these questions with eyetracking.  -->
